This month, we've:
- Fixed some crashes in reader, improved search, and made posts load more smoothly.
- Enabled TikTok embeds in reader.
- Stability improvements to the experimental editor (you should try it if you haven't already!)
- Adjusted how users log into WordPress.com â€“ we hope it'll make it easier for folks to get started.
